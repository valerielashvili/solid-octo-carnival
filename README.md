# solid-octo-carnival-v2

This is a dummy repository I made so you can practice making pull requests. I created the repo as a sample to accompany [this blog post](https://linearb.io/blog/code-review-on-github) I wrote for the LinearB Blog.

Want to practice making pull requests? Just add one here and I'll accept it. Have fun ;)
